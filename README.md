# Frontend Test

To be able to evaluate your capacity to learn we have set up a test for you to 
try a new language and framework and make a quick UI screen for us.

The task will be coded with WPF for Windows. You can use the community edition 
of Visual Studio for this.

An the screen to be coded is the following:

![alt text](mockup.png "Mockup")

Information:

The main window will be called "App"

It will contain a tab menu, with two options:
- Tab1 will show the tables on the mockup
- Tab2 will show an empty screen

As showed the tab1 will contain two tables and one button.

You can force the size for the main screen for not having to deal with the resize
problems of the contents inside the screen.

The first table will contain a title row, and some products under the title.
The rules for this table are the following:
- By default it will show 5 products with a name, and values for 6 months
- The values for each cell will be randomly generated between -99.99 and 99.99, 
and updated once every 5 seconds.
- The first value generated for each cell will be the "base value". After that 
value that will be shown in black colour, any value over that value for that
cell will be shown in red colour, and any value below that value will be shown
as green, if the value is the same of the base value, will be shown in black.

The button "Add product will add a new product to that table"

The second table will contain a title row as well, and some products below.

In this table, some of the products can be expanded to show new sub-produces, 
that will show below the main product if expanded (the icons to expand or 
contract can be different)

The columns Date and group, will have a control to sort the table by date, or
alphabetically by the name of the group.

Feel free to add more values to the table that the ones showed on the mockup.

For both of the tables if the number of rows grows more than the space assigned
for the table, a scroll bar will appear to be able to read all the data.

If during the coding of the application you get stuck or something looks to 
difficult to be implemented, contact with Luis at this email: 
luis@spartacommodities.com, we don't expect you to be able to implement everything
without problems.

After the implementation of the screen, we will arrange a pair-programming 
session to check the code together and make some improvements.

Good luck!!
